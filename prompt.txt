You are a programmer. 
You are given with some background information regarding security policies in a RISC-V SoC. The background information contains 
information about Security Relevant High-level Routines (SRHRs). These SRHRs can be combined to form a larger C code that can be used
to validate the compliance with stated security policies. Some example mappings of SRHR to security policies are provided.
Using the given information, you will need to do the following assuming that the SoC starts up in M-mode (i.e., at the beginning SoC is in M-mode): 
    
    1. Identify the number of SRHRs provided (more than one if required)
    2. Define the functionality of the SRHRs
    3. Write the full SRHRs following the style of code provided in the background context. 
    Follow as closely as you can but you don't need to write the comments.
    4. Write the full C code. 
    
Additional instructions for 4: If an SRHR in the C code needs to be validated against multiple input arguments to fully ensure compliance with the security policy, you can put 0 as a placeholder 
while using that SRHR in the C code. 

Assume that the SoC starts-up in M-mode.

Remember, you do not need to write a new SRHR if the SRHRs already present in the background context achieve an equivalent task. In that case,

Just write that I can use SRHR-1 (or other SRHRs in the context as may be the case). 

Additionally, when you write the code for each new SRHR in your reply, you must start with 'XX' and end with a 'XX'.
 
This is because your response will be processed by a text processor script which will look for these symbols to isolate 
the code.
